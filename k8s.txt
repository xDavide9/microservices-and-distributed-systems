THEORY
kubernetes aka k8s is a application orchestrator
it provides benefits like scaling, load balancing, self-healing and much more
it can consists of a single or more clusters
a cluster is set of nodes where a node is a virtual machine
(that can be run on the cloud with a provider like AWS, GCP, Azure) or physical machine (on premises)
a cluster has a master node and one or more worker nodes
1) the master node (which can be a virtual machine or a physical machine) contains the control plane
which contains the API server, scheduler, controller manager the cluster store (etcd) and the cloud controller manager
analyse each container one by one:
- the api server is the frontend of the control plane, all communication go through it be is external or internal,
  it exposes a restful api on port 443 and performs authentication, authorization checks to access it
- the cluster store contains all the state of the application and configuration of the application,
  like a database for an application it is the single source of truth,
  k8s uses etcd which is a distributed key value store
- the scheduler watches for new workloads/pods and assigns them to the appropriate node based on several factors like
  is the node healthy? is the port available? are there enough resources?
- the controller manager is a daemon that manages the control loop, like a controller of controllers
  in k8s there are a bunch of controllers like the node controller (e.g. the desired state is 1 node and the node dies,
  the node controller will bring a new node to match the desired state), there are other controllers such as the replicaSet, endpoint,
  namespace... each controller watches the api server for changes and ensures that the current state matches the desired state
2) the worker node (which can be a virtual machine or a physical machine) contains the kubelet, kube-proxy and the container runtime
- the kubelet is an agent that runs on each node in the cluster, it makes sure that the containers are running in a pod
  reports node and pod state to the master and receives pod definitions from the api server, it also interacts with the container runtime
- the container runtime is responsible of pulling the images from container registries like dockerhub, gcr, ecr, acr, running containers
  and stopping them if necessary, k8s supports several container runtimes like docker, containerd, cri-o, rkt
- the kube-proxy is an agent that runs on every node through daeamonSets and is responsible of communication between nodes
  (where each node gets its own unique ip address) and routing requests to load balanced services

RUNNING KUBERNETES
running k8s yourself is hard so it's recommended to use a managed solution:
in production most of the companies use managed solutions like GKE, EKS, AKS
for example you could run eks (elastic kubernetes service) from aws via aws fargate (for serverless containers) or aws ec2
where the entire master node is managed and you just focus on the worker nodes which basically consist of your application
you can interact with k8s via the eks console in aws
these solutions are expensive and for learning purposes you can learn k8s locally with minikube, kind or docker
minikube is a tool that runs a single-node k8s cluster (control plane and worker node in the same node) in a virtual machine on your local machine (in this case I'm using the docker engine)
note: make sure enough resources are allocated both to the virtual engine and minikube itself
minikube start --memory=4g
minikube status
minikube ip (to get the ip address of the single-node in the cluster)

INTERACTING WITH THE SINGLE NODE CLUSTER
you need kubectl (kubernetes command line tool) in order to interact with clusters and do any operation
like deploying, inspecting, managing resources, debug, view logs...
note: kubectl is the way to interact with a cluster whether it's running locally for learning purposes or in production with managed solutions like GKE, EKS, AKS

RUNNING HELLO WORLD
1) as a docker container: docker run --rm -p 80:80 amigoscode/kubernetes:hello-world
(this will run a container with a hello world app with the docker engine, it's just there to show the difference with k8s)
2) as a k8s pod: kubectl run hello-world --image=amigoscode/kubernetes:hello-world --port=80
(this will run the same container but within a k8s pod running in our local k8s cluster thanks to minikube)
NOTE: a single number is specified for the port and that's the container port
pods are the smallest deployable unit in k8s, they are a group of one or more containers that communicate internally
via localhost and their port number, there can be a main container, init containers, side containers and volumes
if a pod wants to communicate with another pod they have to use their ip address
NOTE: never create pods directly because they are ephemeral and disposable, always use controllers like deployments
more on controllers: https://semaphoreci.com/blog/replicaset-statefulset-daemonset-deployments
1) deployments are the best way to manage pods, they implement a replicaSet for scaling, rolling updates to ensure the application
is updated one replica at a time, rollbacks to a previous version if something goes wrong, they are self-healing and much more
2) replicaSets are used just for scaling and are generally less powerful than deployments
3) statefulSets are used for stateful applications like databases, they are used when you need to persist data, note that you should use a managed solution for database in production
4) daemonSets are used to run a single copy of a pod per node, so are good for background tasks or monitoring and so on
because they monitor the state of pods and ensure that the desired state matches the current state
but how to access the pod?
in order to access the application deployed in the pod we can use different methods
- port-forwarding which is just for testing or development purposes (do not do in production)
  kubectl port-forward pod/hello-world 8080:80 (which maps the host (my mac) port 8080 to the container port 80, so the application is now
  accessible at localhost:8080), this is not good for production because not only can the port change but also the pod's ip address when for example
  a new version of the service is released so it's just not feasible
- service (preferred way), it has a stable ip, port and dns name and there are different ones like: ClusterIP, NodePort, ExternalName, LoadBalancer
  with this approach service Discovery is used, so we have a service registry where a service's ip address is registered and a human readable name is
  associated and this is working thanks to a dns server like coreDNS
    - ClusterIP is the default service type, it exposes the service on a cluster-internal ip, it's only reachable from within the cluster
    - NodePort is the most basic way to get external traffic directly to your service, it opens a specific port on all nodes and any traffic that is sent to this port is forwarded to the service
    - LoadBalancer is a service that exposes the service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer, it creates a load balancer in the cloud provider and forwards all traffic to the service
    - ExternalName is a service that maps a service to a dns name, it's useful when you want to map a service to a dns name that is outside of the cluster

k8s resources live within a name space (default if not specified), a namespace is a way to divide cluster resources between multiple users
you can use commands like kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system
kubectl create namespace my-namespace
kubectl set context --current --namespace=my-namespace
kubectl get namespaces

Linode is a great and cheap cloud provider to run k8s in production in alternative to the expensive aws, gcp, azure
in order to connect to the cluster with kubectl you need to set the environment variable KUBECONFIG with the path
of the kubeconfig file given to you when you create the cluster
